## Bridgetown starter

This (opiniated) [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com) starter template is based on [Andy Bell’s](https://bell.bz/@andy) talk ‘Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager’ and it’s companion website [buildexcellentwebsit.es](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/), as well as [Lene Saile's](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/) [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) starter template.

It uses progressive enhancement, CSS layout, fluid type & spacing, as well as modern CSS features.
